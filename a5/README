Preamble
--------

A movie database program! Classes adhere to MVC. The user is presented a menu
to select a slew of operations (add, delete, view, search-view, exit). Adding
a movie requires entering the name, year and genre of the movie. 


Compilation Command
-------------------

Run the following command in the root directory of the files:

  make

Run the following command to clear the generated build and runtime files:

make clean


Launching and Operating Instructions
------------------------------------

First launch the server process by entering

	./server

Then launch the client process by entering

	./client

It only works on the same computer since it was unspecified.

Adding a single or multiple movies to the database is done by entering 1 from
the main menu, entering in how many movies you would like to add, then entering
in the respective title, year and genre for each movie.

Delete a movie that is in the database by entering 2 for "Delete a movie", then
entering the full title of the movie to delete.

Display all of the movies currently in the database by entering 3 for "List all
movies" from the main menu.

List all movies of a specific genre by entering 4 at the main menu for "List all
movies by genre" and then entering the respective genre you are interested
in showing.

Exit the program by entering 0 for "Quit" at the main menu. The server will
stop execution as well.
