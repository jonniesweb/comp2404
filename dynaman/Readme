    Dynaman is a game of survival  based on the popular  Bomberman series.  The
game is set in the  Lost universe  where you play your favourite Lost character
trying to escape the forest. This is your story...

    You heard that there  is a hatch buried  beneath some  bushes but you don't
know  exactly where.  To make things worse,  there are deadly  enemies  who are
trying  to  eat your  face off.  The good news is that you  were wise enough to
snag  some dynamite  from the Black  Rock before you left.  Assuming you  don't
blow yourself up,  your job is to blow up enemies and find the hatch.  Dynamite
is  extremely  unstable and  you will only get a couple  seconds to take cover.
Hiding behind trees or bushes is always a good idea.  If you do happen  to come
across the hatch, you will find that there  is a person living there.  Sadly he
will not let you  in until  you've cleared all the enemies.  Trying to ram your
way in will only set off alarms and alert enemies to you. Occasionally you will
encounter  supply crates,  these crates contain  items  which will  aid in your
survival so don't blow them up. Also remember that nightfall is just around the
corner,  you only have a couple minutes to escape before all hell breaks loose.
